# Data Fetching Made Simple with React Query

Fetching data in React apps often requires managing loading states, caching, and error handling manually. **React Query (now TanStack Query)** solves this problem with an elegant, declarative approach.

## What is React Query?

React Query is a **data-fetching and caching library** for React. It simplifies asynchronous state management with features like:

- **Automatic caching**: Avoid refetching the same data unnecessarily.
- **Background refetching**: Keep data fresh without user effort.
- **Built-in loading and error states**: No more manual state management.
- **Infinite queries & pagination**: Simplify complex API data handling.

With React Query, API requests become easier to manage, and your app stays **fast, responsive, and reliable**. It reduces boilerplate code while providing advanced features like query invalidation and cache persistence.

In short, **React Query turns data fetching into a seamless experience**, freeing developers to focus on building features instead of managing API state manually.
