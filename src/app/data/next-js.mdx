# Getting Started with Next.js: The React Framework for Production

Building modern web applications often requires more than just React. **Next.js** is a popular React framework that provides everything you need to create **fast, scalable, and production-ready applications**.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is an **open-source React framework** that adds powerful features such as:

- **File-based routing**: Create pages easily by adding files in the `pages/` directory.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improve SEO and performance with pre-rendered pages.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generate fast, static HTML at build time.
- **API Routes**: Build backend endpoints directly within your Next.js app.

By combining React with SSR and SSG, Next.js bridges the gap between static sites and dynamic applications. Developers can focus on features while Next.js handles optimization under the hood.

In short, **Next.js simplifies React development** by providing a complete toolkit for building modern, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications.
