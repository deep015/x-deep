# Vite: The Next Generation Frontend Build Tool

Traditional bundlers like Webpack can be slow, especially for large projects. **Vite** is a modern frontend build tool that offers a **lightning-fast development experience**.

## Why Vite?

Vite improves performance by using **ES Modules (ESM)** in development, enabling instant server startup and **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** that feels almost instantaneous.

Key features of Vite include:

- **Blazing-fast dev server** powered by native ES modules.
- **Out-of-the-box support** for React, Vue, Svelte, and more.
- **Optimized production builds** using Rollup under the hood.
- **Plugin ecosystem** for extending functionality.

With Vite, you spend less time waiting for builds and more time coding. Itâ€™s designed with modern frameworks in mind, making it a top choice for new projects.

In short, **Vite makes frontend development faster, simpler, and more enjoyable** compared to traditional bundlers.
